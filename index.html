    <h3>Project Details</h3>
    <p><h5><strong>Compact QuadBand Slotted Patch Antenna</strong></h5></p>
    <p>This work presents a quadband antenna, which is compact, low profile, and covers the bandwidth requirements for Bluetooth, C-band, WLAN and WiMAX applications</p>
    <p>In this project, we designed the microstrip patch antenna with different type of slots to get good impedance matching over quad bands to support WLAN and WiMAX applications. The proposed design simulated in CST (computer simulation technology) software.
    The results will be represented in terms of reflection coefficient, radiation pattern, input impedance, bandwidth and gain. We worked on this type of antenna to get resonate in quad bands that are, 2.3 to 2.46 GHz, 288 to 3.72 GHz, and 4.3 to 4.43 and 5 to 8 GHz with |S11| < -10 dB within these operating bands.</p>
